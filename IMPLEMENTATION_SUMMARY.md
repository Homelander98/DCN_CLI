# React Native PDFTron Integration Summary

## 1. Project Setup
- Initialized a new React Native project using the CLI.
- Installed all required dependencies for navigation and PDFTron:
  - `@react-navigation/native`, `@react-navigation/stack`, `react-native-screens`, `react-native-safe-area-context`, `react-native-gesture-handler`, `react-native-reanimated`
  - `@pdftron/react-native-pdf`
  - `deprecated-react-native-prop-types` (for compatibility)

## 2. Directory Structure
- Created a `src` folder with `components` and `screens` subfolders for better organization.

## 3. Navigation
- Set up stack navigation using React Navigation.
- Created two main screens:
  - `HomeScreen`: Lets the user choose to open or edit a PDF.
  - `PDFViewer`: Displays and allows editing of the PDF using PDFTron.

## 4. PDFTron Integration
- Installed and linked the PDFTron React Native module.
- Configured Android build files:
  - Added PDFTron Maven repository to `android/build.gradle`.
  - Updated `android/app/build.gradle` for multidex, packaging options, and dependencies.
  - Updated `AndroidManifest.xml` for required permissions.
- Used the provided PDFTron license key for initialization.

## 5. PDF Viewing and Editing
- Implemented `PDFViewer` component:
  - Initializes PDFTron only once per app session.
  - Loads a demo PDF from a remote URL.
  - Supports both view and edit modes, controlled by navigation params.
  - In edit mode, all annotation and editing features are enabled using the `annotationToolbars` prop.
  - Handles document loading, errors, and navigation events.

## 6. Troubleshooting & Fixes
- Addressed issues with missing dependencies and native modules.
- Ensured all PDFTron features are available in edit mode.
- Cleaned and rebuilt the Android project as needed.
- Removed unused or incompatible code (e.g., `getLicenseInfo`).

## 7. Usage
- Launch the app.
- On the Home screen, choose to open or edit a PDF.
- In edit mode, all PDFTron annotation and editing tools are available.

**This setup provides a robust starting point for a React Native app with full PDF viewing and editing capabilities using PDFTron.**
